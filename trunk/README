Installation
============

This project uses distutil to install the package. This should work on python
2.x, but has only been tested on 2.5+. Please let us know if you have problems
with installing the package.

Installation is not required to use it; you can merely run `./pymei` to start 
the program. The description below is verbatim what distutil's documentation
will tell you, see [distutil's manual](http://docs.python.org/install/) for 
more information.

Globally
--------
Just run a quick

    sudo python setup.py install

Or omit `sudo` if you're already administrator.


Locally
-------
To install in your home dir instead of globally, use

    python setup.py install --home=~

Or possibly 

    python setup.py install --home=~/pymei

to not clutter your homedir too much.


Configuration
=============

In the source dir, there's a pymei.config. setup.py will install this to
$prefix/etc/pymei.config (/etc/pymei.config for a global installation), and
when you start pymei it will look for it three places. In the current directory
(./pymei.config), in your home directory (~/.pymei/config) or in
/etc/pymei.config. The first file found will be used.

Usually you'll copy /etc/pymei.config to ~/.pymei/config, by doing something
like:

    mkdir ~/.pymei
    cp /etc/pymei.config ~/.pymei/config

Then edit this file using your favorite text editor.

The text file is in [JSON](http://json.org) format, and should be fairly human
readable. For information about the various configuration options, see our 
wiki, specifically [this page](http://code.google.com/p/pymei/wiki/Configuration).


Plugins
=======

Some plugins are installed by default, typically in /usr/lib/python?.?/site-packages/mei/plugins/.
These are the *stock plugins*, but you are encouraged to create your own or use
user-contributed ones. These go into `~/.pymei/plugins/`, and all the plugins in
those two dirs are loaded, but the ones in your `~/.pymei/plugins/` will get
priority.

See the information in Configuration on how to load/use plugins, or possibly
the plugin documentation. :)


Reporting problems
==================

If you experience a bug or a problem, check if anyone has experienced similar
issues [on this page](http://code.google.com/p/pymei/issues/list), and either
add your voice to the ones already crying out by posting a comment to the
existing issue or add a new issue to the tracker.
