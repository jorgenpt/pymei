This lists changes from one release to the next, hopefully this covers everything of interest (and a bit more).

It's generated by manually skimming svn log -vr[rev1]:[rev2]. :-)

== v0.1.3 (r42) ==
_(from v0.1.2 (*r28*))_

  * Numerous fixes to embedded mplayer - this should solve all issues related to separate_window: False
    * Make cursor be hidden properly.
    * Allow for pausing_keep_force in new mplayers, and just send 'pause' instead of space in old mplayers. This fixes a bug where space wouldn't unpause.
  * Reorganize a bit; put version info into mei.version, move config to example_configuration/pymei.config
  * Make theme more YAML-y
  * Add new widgets to facilitate for new XKCD plugin (which is highly undocumented):
    * TextBox - displays text in a set area, aligning it as desired and splitting too long lines.
    * ScrollableImage - displays an image in a set area, and allows scrolling.
  * Bundle fonts, and add a LICENSE that hopefully covers this. :-)
  * Add a debug server in debug: true that gives a python console via telnet, with access to pymei.
  * Handle plugin dependencies nicer.
  * Add XKCD-plugin!
