PyMei is a Python Media Interface. It's designed to run as a fullscreen application, navigated by a keyboard or a lirc input device. It plays videos or shows other types of media using external programs like mplayer.

It's designed to be extensible by "plugins", also written in Python, and extensively themeable to customize the look. While it in theory should work for Microsoft Windows, it hasn't been tested yet.

PyMei is written by Jørgen P. Tjernø as a hobby-project, and used on his own HTPC.
